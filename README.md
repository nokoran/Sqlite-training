# SQLite Practice Scripts

A collection of SQL scripts created while learning SQLite. This repository covers everything from basic CRUD operations to advanced subqueries.

## Contents

* **Basics:** Creating tables, inserting data, updates, and deletes.
* **Queries:** Selects, aggregations, and grouping.
* **Joins:** Inner and Outer joins, plus joins with grouping.
* **Advanced:** Standard and correlated subqueries.

## Getting Started

This repository includes a Visual Studio solution file (`sql.sln`). You can open that to view the file structure, or simply browse the folders to access the raw SQL files.
